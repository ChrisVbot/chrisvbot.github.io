Back again with another blog post! 

I've [deployed a simple React app to Heroku](https://polar-gorge-98193.herokuapp.com/) and [here's](https://github.com/ChrisVbot/react-redux-store-app) the source code. I plan to tinker with it a bit more still, but I'm also looking forward to creating my next React app from scratch using all that I've learned while making my first one. 

In other news, I've pretty much completed my next project at work. It turned out to be sort of an intro to JavaScript course with a bunch of ES6 stuff mixed in. I actually learned a great deal about the fundamentals of JavaScript while making it. I definitely gained a more solid understanding of prototypal inheritance, promises, OOP in JS, plus a lot more. In terms of ES6 specific stuff, I really like [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), [for...of loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), and [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). While I have used most of these features in other projects, it was nice to take time to explore each in great detail. Plus I think it's true that by instructing a topic, you end up learning a lot about that topic yourself. I have great respect for instructors who can break a complex topic down into something easy to understand and aspire to be able to do so myself. 

Otherwise, I've spent a bit of time familiarizing myself with [CSS grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). It's so great to be able to easily write out some simple code and format content in a way that would've been a real pain before CSS grids. Also, it seems [support is now really good](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) across the board for all modern browsers. At this point, I feel pretty confident in using Flexbox, so that, combined with CSS grids, will make it relatively straightforward to create some wicked stuff. I've basically just dipped my toes a bit into grids, though, so I'm looking forward to learning a lot more. Some of the resources I've been learning from are: [egghead.io's course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-complex-layouts-with-css-grid-layout), [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/), Rachel Andrew's [Grid by Example](http://gridbyexample.com/), and the ever-helpful CSS-Tricks' [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/). 

In other news, I'm volunteering as a mentor for the first time next week at a JavaScript workshop at Lighthouse Labs and I'm really looking forward to it. It will be great to give back to the community and here's hoping everything goes well! 

That's it for now, catch ya on the flip side!
