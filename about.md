### About me 

I'm Chris Veillette <small>(vƒÅy-ette)</small>, a junior full-stack web developer in Vancouver, B.C. I graduated from [Lighthouse Labs](https://lighthouselabs.ca/) in September 2016 (highly recommend!) and since then I've been working on gettin' good (at coding). I love writing functional code and I'm always trying to learn something new.

When I'm not doing that, I'm usually doing something like reading or catching a movie. 

Note: This website is still a work in progress! -please imagine an under construction gif here-
